This is the blog of the [Symbid](http://symbid.com) development team. Here we will write about the tools we use and the projects we share on [GitHub](https://github.com/Symbid) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/symbid/).

## About Symbid

In 2011 [Symbid](http://symbid.com) began as one of the first investment crowdfunding platforms in the world with one mission: To help entrepreneurs find funding and start their business, by asking funding from the “crowd”. At Symbid, everyone can become an investor, from as little as 20 euro or much more. We answer a strong need in today’s business world: information technology, which democratizes, personalizes and connects the world of finance. 

We have since developed into The Funding Network bringing online finance solutions to entrepreneurs, institutional investors and the crowd. In essence, we strive for symbiosis between all who wish to connect, fund and grow in the world of SME finance, however big or small.

That is our mission. 
*“To enable the flow of funding worldwide.”*

The Funding Network by Symbid will be the fastest and most efficient capital market for private entreprises
